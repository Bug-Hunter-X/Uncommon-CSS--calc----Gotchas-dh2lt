This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors that can occur when using the `calc()` function in CSS. The `bug.css` file shows the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected versions. The first error involves incorrect unit handling within a calculation, and the second involves issues with nested `calc()` functions that can lead to unexpected results if not properly parenthesized.  The README provides detailed explanations of each error and their solutions.
