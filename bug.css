The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can produce unexpected results if you are not careful with operator precedence and unit handling. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10%);` might not behave as expected.  Another issue is with nested calculations. The browser's parsing can be unpredictable if you nest `calc()` within other `calc()` expressions without proper parentheses.
